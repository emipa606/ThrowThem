[i]Grenades? What grenades? You never used grenades? Time to change it! MAKE GRENADES GREAT AGAIN![/i]

[img]https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1688275504674589907/03090D743698DBEBCC5AACE54A22768A8C5FC8DD/?imw=5000&amp;amp;imh=5000&amp;amp;ima=fit&amp;amp;impolicy=Letterbox&amp;amp;imcolor=%23000000&amp;amp;letterbox=false[/img]

This mod creates a gizmo (button) on pawns for every type of grenade in their inventory. When pawn is drafted you can issue him an order to throw grenade without equipping. It works the same way as if it was equipped, but now you don't need to make those 10 clicks to swap weapons.
[i]Grenades should enchance combat, not cripple it.[/i]

However, since vanilla doesn't have an option to pick up items into inventory, you need another mod that will allow that (ex. Pick Up And Haul or Combat Extended).

[h1]Bugs and suggestions[/h1]

If you encounter any errors related to this mod or notice bugs, please post about it into [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2586553860/3039354735028632799/]bug reports section[/url]. If I can't reproduce it - I probably won't be able to fix it, so provide steps how to reproduce bugs.
Also feel free to post any suggestions in comments on how to make this mod better.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Any mod should work fine with this mod.
By default only vanilla grenades and any modded grenades based on vanilla will appear as buttons.

Completely safe to add and remove midgame.

[h1]Combat Extended is fully compatible![/h1]
